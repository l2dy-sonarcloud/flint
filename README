Flint is released under the ISC license, please see COPYRIGHT for more
information.

Flint was developed for Apache, PHP5 and SQLite. It also uses the
PDO_SQLITE driver for PHP5. All you should have to do to get it up and
running is to use the db/schema.sql file to create the db/flint.db
database and setup a virtual host under Apache.

Flint now uses bcrypt for password hashing which relies on the openssl
extension to generate random bytes. If you are upgrading from a previous
version of Flint you will need to run the following SQL statement
against db/flint.db:

ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN hash text;

Here is an example VirtualHost:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName flint.tld
    ServerAlias www.flint.tld
    ServerAdmin you@flint.tld
    DocumentRoot /var/www/htdocs/flint/public
    ErrorLog /var/www/logs/flint.tld/error_log
    CustomLog /var/www/logs/flint.tld/access_log combined

    ScriptAliasMatch ^/user/(.*)/repository/(.*) \
        /var/www/htdocs/flint/repos/$1/repository/$2

    <Directory "/var/www/htdocs/flint/repos">
        AllowOverride None
        Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

You will also want to make sure your setup works with .htaccess files
and that db/flint.db and repos/ is writable by the user running apache.
